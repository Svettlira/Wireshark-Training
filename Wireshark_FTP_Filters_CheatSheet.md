## Suggested Workflow for Investigation
1. Filter for all USER commands to see attempted usernames.  
2. Use `ftp.response.code == 530` to identify failed logins.  
3. Check `ftp.response.code == 230` for successful logins.  
4. Filter for `RETR` or `STOR` to identify file transfers.  
5. Switch to `ftp-data` filter to view the actual file contents.
